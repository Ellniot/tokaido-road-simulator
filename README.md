tokaido-road-simulator

This is a python app I created to simulate different strategies within the game Tokaido Road.

More info about the game may be found here: [Tokaido Road](https://www.boardgamehalv.com/tokaido/)

The script is designed to read in configurations for board layout, number of players, and the strategy for each player. The script then (optionally) draws the board with turtles and animates the gameplay. A strategy is an ordered list of preferences for which space the player would prefer to land on.



I made this to hopefully beat my roommate at this game, which I am yet to do.
